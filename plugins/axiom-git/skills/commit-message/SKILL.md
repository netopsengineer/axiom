  Use ANY time the user signals they want to commit staged changes — including
  bare "commit", "/commit", "commit this", "commit these changes", "let's commit",
  "make a commit", "git commit", "write a commit message", "make a conventional
  commit", "use conventional commits", or any equivalent phrasing in context
  (e.g., right after staging files, "ready to commit", "okay ship it").
  Composes a Conventional Commits message with a gitmoji prefix: reads the
  staged diff, decides type, scope, emoji, subject, body, and footer using the
  rubrics in this file, shows one assembled message in a fenced block, and
  commits after a single yes/no confirmation. It writes the commit message
  only — NOT other prose about the staged changes: not PR/MR descriptions,
  not release notes, not changelogs or summaries. Also do NOT use for
  questions *about* git or *about* conventional commits, amending, rebasing,
  cherry-picking, reverting/undoing commits, or viewing log history.

# Commit Message Generation

Read the staged diff, decide every field yourself using the rubrics below, and surface **one** assembled message for a single yes/no confirmation. Don't prompt field-by-field (a GUI extension can afford that; a chat turn can't), and don't short-circuit to a bare `git commit -m "fix stuff"` — if this skill loaded, run the full flow and never bypass hooks.

## Repo defaults

```text
Format:           <type>(<scope>): <emoji> <subject>
Emoji style:      Unicode glyph (e.g. 🐛 not :bug:)
Scope default:    none (include only if the diff points clearly at one)
Co-Authored-By:   off (this repo's history doesn't use the trailer)
Body default:     skip unless the diff is non-trivial (>~10 lines, multi-file, or non-obvious why)
Footer default:   skip; reserve for `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `Closes #N`
Subject limits:   warn at >50 chars; hard cap at 72
Hooks:            gitleaks runs pre-commit; do not bypass on failure
```

These are bootstrap defaults from this repo's history. In a different repo, re-detect during preflight (Phase 1 step 5) and adjust silently — observed in-repo history wins.

## When to ask the user

Only stop and ask in these cases — otherwise decide and continue:

1. **Nothing staged.** Offer to stage by filename (never `git add -A`/`-u`/`.`).
2. **On `master`, `main`, or detached HEAD.** Offer to create a new branch, move the staged changes there, then resume on that branch. Refuse to commit directly to master/main.
3. **Suspicious staged content** (`.env*`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, files ≥1 MB, secrets in diff). Show the offending file/line, ask whether to unstage or proceed.
4. **Genuinely ambiguous type or emoji choice** — i.e., two options are equally defensible from the rubric and the choice changes how a reader will interpret the commit (e.g., `feat` vs `fix` when the change adds a new code path that also corrects bad behavior). State the options and the tradeoff in one line, then wait. If the rubric picks a clear winner, do not ask.
5. **Final assembled message.** Always show the complete commit message in a fenced block and wait for explicit confirmation before running `git commit`.

If the user's invoking message unambiguously specifies the subject ("commit this as a fix to the OAuth timeout"), step 5 may be skipped — otherwise still confirm.

## Phase 1 — Preflight (silent unless something fails)

Run these checks in parallel where possible. Surface results to the user only if one fails or trips an "ask" condition above.

1. **Staged changes.** `git diff --cached --stat`. If empty, follow ask-condition #1.
2. **Branch.** `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. If `master`, `main`, or `HEAD` (detached), follow ask-condition #2. Any other branch name is fine — feature/, fix/, chore/, bare names, prefixed names, all acceptable.
3. **Stage summary.** `git diff --cached --name-status` + `--stat`. Flag suspicious paths per ask-condition #3.
4. **Sensitive-content sniff.** Scan the whole staged diff for likely-live credentials, not just the top:

   ```bash
   git diff --cached | grep -E -i \
     '(password|secret|api[_-]?key|BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|aws_secret_access_key)[[:space:]]*[=:]' \
     | head -20
   ```

   Any hit → follow ask-condition #3. The `[=:]` anchor avoids false positives on the bare word "password" appearing in prose or comments.
5. **Repo-convention sniff.** `git log --pretty=%s -20` and `git log -20 --format=%B`:
   - Count Unicode glyphs vs `:code:` in subjects → output emoji style.
   - Count `(scope)` parens → scope-default on/off.
   - Look for `Co-Authored-By:` → trailer default.

   If detected defaults differ from the "Repo defaults" block above, prefer the detected ones; note the mismatch in the final-confirmation summary but don't block on it.

### Moving off master/main

If the branch check trips, propose a branch name derived from the staged diff (e.g., from the most-changed top-level dir, or the subject about to be drafted). Confirm the name, then:

```bash
git stash --keep-index   # preserve staged set, set aside any unstaged work
git switch -c <new-branch>
git stash pop || true    # restore unstaged work onto the new branch
```

Then resume preflight on the new branch. Don't commit on the original branch under any circumstances.

## Phase 2 — Decide every field

Work through these in order using the rubrics below and produce a single assembled commit message. No per-field prompts.

### Type rubric

Paths below are illustrative — match on the *signal* (only tests touched, mostly renames, new behavior), not the exact paths, so this generalizes across repos.

| signal in diff                                                                                              | type                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Only test files touched (e.g., `tests/**`, `**/*_test.go`, `**/*.spec.ts`)                                  | test                |
| Only `**/*.md`, `doc/**`, and the file is genuinely docs (not operational instructions)                     | docs                |
| Only CI config (`.github/workflows/**`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `.circleci/**`)                                   | ci                  |
| Only build configs, dependency manifests (`pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `Dockerfile`), or setup scripts | build               |
| Mostly `R` status (renames/moves) in `git diff --cached --name-status`                                      | refactor (emoji 🚚) |
| New file with new behavior; new template/role/module; new agent/skill definition                            | feat                |
| Modifies existing behavior to fix wrong output, error, regression                                           | fix                 |
| Reorganization without behavior change                                                                      | refactor            |
| Speed / resource-use improvement with no behavior change                                                    | perf                |
| `git revert`-style change (HEAD~1 is a "Revert ..." or message starts with `revert:`)                       | revert              |
| Whitespace / formatting only                                                                                | style               |
| Catch-all                                                                                                   | chore               |

Operational `.md` files (skills, agent instructions, runbook-style READMEs) lean **feat**/**chore**, not **docs**. The `docs` type is reserved for genuine documentation *of* something else (READMEs about code, architecture notes, charter docs).

### Scope rubric

Default: **omit**. Include a scope only if all the staged paths cluster under one directory that maps to an obvious name. Spans multiple top-level dirs → no scope. If repo history overwhelmingly skips scope (detected in Phase 1 step 5), only include if the diff really demands it.

### Emoji rubric

Pick the contextual emoji if one fits, else the type default:

- **feat** ✨ — alternates: 🎉 (initial commit), 🚸 (UX), 🏗️ (architecture), 🧑‍💻 (DX tooling / `.claude/` changes)
- **fix** 🐛 — alternates: 🚑️ (critical hotfix), 🩹 (non-critical/one-liner), 🔒️ (security: auth, secrets, CVE)
- **docs** 📝 — alternates: 💡 (in-code comments), 📄 (license)
- **style** 🎨 — alternates: ✏️ (typo)
- **refactor** ♻️ — alternates: 🚚 (mostly `R` renames/moves), 🔥 (deleted code dominates), ⚰️ (dead code removal)
- **perf** ⚡️
- **test** ✅ — alternates: 🧪 (failing test added), 📸 (snapshots)
- **build** 👷 — alternates: 📦️ (compiled output), ⬆️/⬇️/➕/➖/📌 (only lockfile/manifest changes)
- **ci** 💚 — alternates: 👷 (build system)
- **chore** 🔧 — alternates: 🔨 (dev scripts), 🙈 (.gitignore), 🏷️ (types)
- **revert** ⏪️

For the full glyph list and `:code:` mapping (used if the repo-convention sniff in Phase 1 detects `:code:` style, or if the user requests a different emoji by name), see `references/gitmoji.md`.

**Emoji glyph integrity:** several glyphs include a U+FE0F variation selector that forces emoji-style rendering (🚑️, 🔒️, ♻️, ⚡️, ✏️, ⏪️, 🏷️, 📦️, 🗑️, 🔍️). Copy the glyph as-is — do not strip the variation selector or these will render as monochrome text on some clients.

### Subject rules

- Imperative mood ("Add X", not "Added X").
- No trailing period.
- Capitalize the first word.
- Do not repeat the type ("Add X", not "feat: Add X").
- Target ≤50 chars. Warn (in the final summary) at 50, hard-refuse at 72.
- The diff is the source of truth — describe the change, not the motivation.

### Body rules

Include a body only if:

- Diff is ≥10 lines changed, **or**
- Spans multiple files, **or**
- The *why* is non-obvious from the diff (constraint, prior incident, ticket context).

When included: 1–3 sentences, wrapped at 72 cols, focused on *why*, not *what*.

### Footer rules

Include only when:

- Diff includes a breaking change (public API change, schema/migration, removed config key) → `BREAKING CHANGE: <one-line description>`.
- User mentioned a ticket number in conversation → `Closes #N` or `Refs #N`.

## Phase 3 — Confirm and commit

1. **Assemble:**

   ```text
   {type}({scope}): {emoji} {subject}

   {body}

   {footer}
   ```

   Drop `(scope)` if no scope. Single space between emoji and subject. Blank line before body and before footer; omit either block entirely if empty. No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer unless repo-convention sniff demanded it.

2. **Show the full message** in a fenced code block. Note any caveats inline: "subject is 58 chars (over 50 warn line)", "convention sniff disagrees with repo defaults — using detected style". Ask once: confirm or revise?

3. **On confirm, commit via heredoc:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <type>(<scope>): <emoji> <subject>

   <body>

   <footer>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

   Single `git commit` call. Do not stage anything new at this step.

4. **Verify** with `git log -1 --format=%B` so the user sees what actually landed (including any hook-injected trailers).

5. **If the user revises** something on the confirmation step, apply the change and re-show the full message. Don't restart the flow.

## Failure modes

Nothing staged, on master/main, and suspicious staged content are decision gates — handle them per *When to ask the user*. The rest:

- **Hook failure (gitleaks etc.).** The commit did *not* land. Surface the hook output verbatim. Don't retry with `--no-verify` and don't `--amend` (nothing to amend) — the user fixes the root cause, re-stages, and re-invokes for a fresh commit.
- **User abandons mid-flow** ("never mind", "cancel"). Stop without committing; leave staging untouched.
- **User asks for `--amend`.** This skill only creates new commits. Direct them to `git commit --amend` manually, or `git reset --soft HEAD~1` + re-invoke.
- **Subject exceeds 72 chars.** Hard refuse. Trim or move detail to the body before confirming.
- **Multi-line subject pasted.** Treat the first line as the subject; move everything after it into the body.

## Out of scope

No commitlint integration (no config in this repo — the rubrics here are the contract; revisit if `.commitlintrc*` lands). No persistent scope cache — re-derive from the diff each time. No `[skip ci]`, no interactive `git add -p` (stage first), no amend/rebase, and no bypass flags (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `-n`).
